# Cloud-Data-Engineering-Portfolio
My journey through modern data engineering.  Currently implementing GCP use cases (BigQuery, Dataflow, Composer) to master the Professional Data Engineer certification. Roadmap includes future expansions into AWS, Databricks, and Snowflake to demonstrate expertise in multi-cloud data architecture, ETL/ELT, and Infrastructure as Code.
